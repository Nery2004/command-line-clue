Here it is - the untouched crime scene! The stillness of this room suggests no one has entered since the incident.

Your careful detective work has paid off. The empty state of this room matches
witness accounts - no one was around when the crime occurred. This must be
where the murderer carried out their plan!

Make sure to document this discovery in your notebook.md file along with your
